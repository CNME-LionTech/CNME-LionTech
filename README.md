# Team LionTech

## Who We Are

Team LionTech is a student technology team from Colegiul National "Mihai Eminescu" Oradea, Romania. We are passionate about space science, programming, robotics, and applying technology to solve real-world problems. Our team consists of dedicated high school students guided by experienced mentor teachers.

## Our Mission

To inspire and educate the next generation of scientists, engineers, and innovators through hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology and participation in international competitions.

## Our Projects

### ESA AstroPi Mission Space Lab
We have been proud participants in the European Space Agency's AstroPi Mission Space Lab competition for multiple years. This prestigious program allows students to write code that runs on Raspberry Pi computers aboard the International Space Station.

#### 2023/2024 Mission
Our current mission focuses on calculating the orbital speed of the ISS through image processing and feature tracking between sequential photographs of Earth.

#### 2022/2023 Mission

#### 2021/2022 Mission
We developed algorithms to identify landmarks and reference points in Earth photography, determine ISS speed, and classify cloud patterns over land and sea.

#### 2020/2021 Mission
