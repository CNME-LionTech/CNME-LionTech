# Team LionTech

## Who We Are

Team LionTech is a student technology team from Colegiul National "Mihai Eminescu" Oradea, Romania. We are passionate about space science, programming, robotics, and applying technology to solve real-world problems. Our team consists of dedicated high school students guided by experienced mentor teachers.

## Our Mission

To inspire and educate the next generation of scientists, engineers, and innovators through hands-on experience with cutting-edge technology and participation in international competitions.

## Our Projects

### ESA AstroPi Mission Space Lab
We have been proud participants in the European Space Agency's AstroPi Mission Space Lab competition for multiple years. This prestigious program allows students to write code that runs on Raspberry Pi computers aboard the International Space Station.

#### 2023/2024 Mission
Our current mission focuses on calculating the orbital speed of the ISS through image processing and feature tracking between sequential photographs of Earth.

#### 2022/2023 Mission - [AstroPi-MSL-Report-LionTech-2023.pdf](https://github.com/CNME-LionTech/AstroPi-2023/blob/main/reports/AstroPi%20MSL%20Report%20LionTech%202023.pdf)
Our mission focused on the analysis of cloud patterns and detection of atmospheric gravity waves using machine learning. We:
- Collected 1,389 images and over 103,870 sensor data samples during a 3-hour run on the ISS
- Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify atmospheric wave patterns
- Applied spectral analysis using 2D Fast Fourier Transform to study wave characteristics
- Used TensorFlow and image processing techniques to analyze cloud formations

#### 2021/2022 Mission
We developed algorithms to identify landmarks and reference points in Earth photography, determine ISS speed, and classify cloud patterns over land and sea.

#### 2020/2021 Mission - [AstroPi-MSL-Report-LionTech-2021.pdf](https://github.com/CNME-LionTech/AstroPi-2021/blob/main/report/AstroPi-MSL-Report-LionTech-2021.pdf)
Our award-winning mission focused on:
- Determining ISS orbital speed using OpenCV with KAZE 2D Features detection algorithm
- Developing advanced cloud classification using CNN with Keras
- Creating smoke and pollution detection algorithms for land images
- Analyzing cloud patterns over both land and sea
- Collecting 1,376 images and 29,373 sensor data samples during a 3-hour run (April 24, 2021)
- Using specialized metrics like Red-Blue Ratio (RBR) and Normalized Red-Blue Ratio (NRBR)
- Successfully measuring ISS velocity between 6.4-8.8 km/s using Ground Sampling Distance method
